Homework 1-

1. projmot.py: Function takes variable t that acts as time, and uses kinematic equations to output velocity and height of a particle 
following the specified trajectory after the given amount of time.

2. expression.py: Defines the variables V0, a, and z, and evaluates the assigned expression using those values.  Then changes the value
of z and finds the new value of the expression.

3. form.py: Takes in the string "a", "b", or "c" and evaluates the corresponding expression.

4. quadform.py: Function with arguments a, b, and c that act as coefficients in a quadratic equation.  The function evaluates the discriminant
of the equation to see if the solution will be real, and then prints the real/imaginary roots of the equation.

Homework 2-

1. array1.py: Creates an array of 9 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 29 and prints it.  Then squares every number in the array and prints
that.  Then doubles each element through addition and multiplication separately and prints the result of each.

2. array2.py: Uses the exp() and ones() functions of numpy to create an array of 100 elements all equal to euler's number.  Then creates
an array with degrees from 0 to 360.  Uses the previous array to do the same thing in radians.  Then it uses the arange() function to create
an array that goes from 12 to 17 in increments of 0.2, both inclusive and exclusive.

3. projarray.py: Creates an array of the heights of a falling ball descending in increments of 0.5.  Then finds the corresponding time to each 
height.
